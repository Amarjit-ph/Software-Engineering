# Software Engineering
This repository is the documentation of my journey,
Started from a small town called Imphal in the North-Eastern part of India,
Where getting a public job is the only goal & safest way to live a life,
Defying everything to pursue my passion and
Choosing a social misfit career as Computer Science Engineer
To become a Software Engineer & A first-generation entrepreneur.
> “When you discover your mission, you will feel its demand. It will fill you with enthusiasm and a burning desire to get to work on it.” — W. Clement Stone
