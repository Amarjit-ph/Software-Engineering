# Software Engineering
This repository is the documentation of my journey,
Started from a small town called Imphal in the North-Eastern part of India,
Where getting a public job is the only goal & safest way to live a life,
Defying everything to pursue my passion and
Choosing a social misfit career as Computer Science Engineer
To become a Software Engineer & A first-generation entrepreneur.

## How I Navigate in this Journey ?
