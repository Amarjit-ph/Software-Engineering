# Software Engineering
This repository is the documentation of my journey,
Started from a small town called Imphal in the North-Eastern part of India,
Where getting a public job is the only goal & safest way to live a life,
Defying everything to pursue my passion and
Choosing a social misfit career as Computer Science Engineer
To become a Software Engineer & A first-generation entrepreneur.
> “When you discover your mission, you will feel its demand. It will fill you with enthusiasm and a burning desire to get to work on it.” — W. Clement Stone

## FAQ

**What is a SDK (Software Development Kit) ?**<br/>
An SDK is just a pre-packaged set of code (for a specific language) that you don’t have to write yourself.Sometimes free and sometimes you have to, purchase them.There are all sorts of other SDKs out there including things like an SDK to simplify building a User Interface.The downside of the SDK is its size. It has many functionalities that one app might not use, also as SDK should be consistent over time, it should have the older versions which make them even larger over time. Also, as they run on our thread, they could have security issues, as well as malware. It is better to make a good document for API vs an SDK. But big companies like to create SDK to obscure data from developers. So never use an SDK unless it is open source.
